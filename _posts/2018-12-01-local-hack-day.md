On the first day of December, CompSoc hosted the annual Local Hack Day. 

Despite the imminent exams breathing down their necks, over 20 passionate hackers dedicated their day to come into AT and create something exciting and new. 

The team **“It’s Easy!”** tackled the website redesign challenge, adding a little twist – Using the provided Azure credits, they implemented facial recognition for members of their concept site! They make it look so… well, easy!

Team **"Wuwin"** took their shot at reinventing the wheel. Just not the one you're thinking of... To be more precise, a ring... They're bringing the classic drinking game Ring of Fire to the web!

Team **"v.0.5"** were building a game involving helicopters, paratroopers, and whatnot.

**Cody** worked on _Monad for the digital era_ (Not the same Monads you learnt about in Functional Programming)! It's essentially some sort of card game... And yes, that mouse is from a while ago.

**Dylan** has taken up the Sisyphean task of developing a game with Haskell and ncurses. Press F to pay respects.

Team **"ChachaVidhayak"** developed AlcoMender, which picks an alcoholic beverage for you based on your mood that it detects through a picture! An interesting use of Machine Learning!
